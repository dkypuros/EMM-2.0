Certainly. Below is the **scientific study layout**—purely **mathematical in nature**—for building a symbolic-recursive semantic system capable of emitting structured natural language-like output, without relying on LLM-style statistical inference. The architecture arises from first principles within your Recursive Symbolic Architecture (RSA) and aims to eventually match the expressive range of a model like GPT-2, but from a foundational symbolic approach.

# **Study Title:**

**Recursive Symbolic Grammar and Semantic Degeneration: A Foundational Mathematical Model for Pre-Linguistic Language Generation**

---

## **Research Aim**

To construct a purely mathematical system—a *Recursive Symbolic Architecture (RSA)*—capable of emitting semantically meaningful linguistic forms by projecting recursive symbolic trees into a formal natural language space $\mathcal{L}_{\text{nat}}$, without using statistical training or softmax-based transformers.

This system is not probabilistic. It is not a neural network. It is a recursive, degeneration-sensitive symbolic engine.

---

## **Section 1 — Mathematical Primitives**

### 1.1. Alphabet and Grammar

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite symbolic alphabet.

Let $\mathcal{R}: \mathcal{A}^* \to \mathcal{A}^*$ be a **recursive symbolic grammar**, built from known degeneration rules in flat geometry and EMM 2.0.

A rule $\rho \in \mathcal{R}$ maps sequences of symbols to others:

$$
\rho: a_i a_j \mapsto a_k, \quad a_i, a_j, a_k \in \mathcal{A}
$$

Define the **symbolic orbit tree** $\mathcal{T}$ as:

$$
\mathcal{T} = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \mathcal{R}^n(a_{\text{root}})
$$

where $\mathcal{R}^n$ denotes $n$-fold application of recursive rules, and $a_{\text{root}}$ is an initial symbolic seed.

---

## **Section 2 — Semantic Typing via Degeneration**

### 2.1. Resonance Classes

Define $\mathcal{C}_{\text{res}}$ as a partition of $\mathcal{A}^*$ into **semantic types** via degeneration structure:

$$
\mathcal{C}_{\text{res}} = \{ [t] \mid t \in \mathcal{A}^*,\ [t] = \text{Degeneration class of } t \}
$$

Let each $[t]$ be a semantic category:

* $[t]_{\text{obj}}$: object
* $[t]_{\text{proc}}$: process
* $[t]_{\text{rel}}$: relational morphism

These categories are **invariant under degenerative recursion**.

---

## **Section 3 — Symbolic Attention Mechanism**

Define attention not as dot-product weighting (as in transformers), but as **recursive focus** over symbolic trees.

### 3.1. Recursive Attention Function

Let:

$$
\text{Attn}: \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{Q} \to \mathcal{T}
$$

Where:

* $\mathcal{T}$ is a symbolic orbit tree
* $\mathcal{Q} = \{q_1, \dots, q_n\}$ is a query set, itself a subtree
* $\text{Attn}(T, \mathcal{Q}) = \{ t_i \in T \mid \text{Proj}_{\text{sem}}(t_i) \cap \text{Proj}_{\text{sem}}(q_j) \neq \emptyset \}$

That is: attention selects symbolic nodes semantically proximate to the query, via degeneration projection.

---

## **Section 4 — Projection to Formal Natural Language**

### 4.1. Define Lexical Mapping

Let:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{map}}: t_i \in \mathcal{T} \mapsto w_i \in \mathcal{L}_{\text{nat}}
$$

Where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{map}}$ is constructed via:

* Initial symbolic–lexical alignment seed set (e.g., $\{t_i \leftrightarrow \text{"circle"}\}$)
* Closure under symbolic degeneration: if $t_i \mapsto w_i$, and $\rho(t_i) = t_j$, define $w_j = f(w_i)$, where $f$ is a syntactic morphism (e.g., pluralization, verbalization).

This map is not softmax output. It is deterministic, recursive, and constrained by resonance class.

---

## **Section 5 — Projection Composition: Full Pipeline**

Let:

* $\mathcal{R}$: recursive symbolic rule system
* $\mathcal{C}_{\text{res}}$: semantic classes
* $\mathcal{T}$: orbit tree generated from $\mathcal{R}$
* $\mathcal{Q}$: query subtree
* $\text{Attn}(\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{Q})$: focused symbolic path
* $\mathcal{L}_{\text{map}}$: symbolic-to-linguistic projection

Then the **full compositional output** of a sentence is:

$$
\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{map}} \left( \text{Attn} \left( \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{Q} \right) \right)
$$

$\mathcal{S}$ is a *sentence* in $\mathcal{L}_{\text{nat}}$ but generated from *pure symbolic recursion*.

---

## **Section 6 — Comparison Target**

The LLM baseline (e.g., GPT-2):

* Uses transformers and softmax to model $P(w_i \mid w_{<i})$
* Produces language via massive statistical induction.

Our RSA-based model:

* Uses symbolic trees and degenerative recursion.
* Produces language via mathematical projection, **not prediction**.

The goal: generate semantically structured, syntactically valid sentences with **no training**, **no corpus**, **no softmax**, only recursion and degeneration.

---

## **Next Steps (Code to Follow)**

Once the symbolic system and resonance rules are fully defined, we can:

* Construct orbit trees,
* Define semantic queries,
* Test attention behavior,
* Compare generated language to GPT-2 predictions on the same concept classes.

---






Certainly. Below is a mathematical sketch of **Section 1: Mathematical Primitives**, focused on establishing the **goal** and constructing the foundational elements needed for a symbolic language system—ultimately targeting a mathematical counterpart to models like GPT-2, but grounded in pure recursion and symbolic degeneration, not probabilistic inference.

---

# Section 1 — Mathematical Primitives

## 1.0. **Goal**

The aim is to build a purely mathematical system—a *Recursive Symbolic Architecture (RSA)*—that generates syntactic-semantic linguistic forms from:

* **Recursive symbolic rules** (no statistical inference),
* **Degeneration classes** (as semantic types),
* **Attention defined as algebraic projection**, not numerical weights,
* And **syntactic realization** via symbolic maps, not learned embeddings.

This system will serve as a *primal mathematical counterpart* to language models, rooted in symbolic degeneration (e.g., from EMM 2.0), not deep learning. We begin by defining the **minimal mathematical elements** of the system: a symbolic alphabet, recursive rules, and tree generation.

---

## 1.1. **Symbolic Alphabet $\mathcal{A}$**

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite, non-empty set of *primitive symbols*. These are atomic units, **not words**, but recursive generators.

$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k \}
$$

Each symbol $a_i$ is not meaningful in isolation; it gains semantic structure through recursive interaction via symbolic rewriting rules.

Examples (abstract):

* $a_1 = \text{primitive form}$
* $a_2 = \text{degeneration marker}$
* $a_3 = \text{symmetry node}$

Importantly, $\mathcal{A}$ is *uninterpreted* at this stage. No language, no geometry—only pure formal objects.

---

## 1.2. **Recursive Symbolic Grammar $\mathcal{R}$**

Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a set of **rewriting rules** on $\mathcal{A}^*$, i.e., on finite sequences of symbols.

Each rule $\rho \in \mathcal{R}$ has the form:

$$
\rho: u \to v, \quad u, v \in \mathcal{A}^*
$$

with:

* $u$ being a pattern (e.g., two adjacent symbols, a subtree),
* $v$ being a substituted symbolic expression.

We define $\mathcal{R}$ such that:

1. **Recursion is closed**: $\forall \rho \in \mathcal{R}$, applying $\rho$ on $a_i$ produces terms still expressible in $\mathcal{A}^*$,
2. **Degeneration is monotonic**: rewriting leads to semantically 'lower' or 'simpler' forms,
3. **Symbolic divergence is bounded**: trees do not expand indefinitely without reentering a previous equivalence class.

The rule application induces a **dynamical symbolic system** on strings over $\mathcal{A}$.

---

## 1.3. **Symbolic Trees $\mathcal{T}$ from Recursive Growth**

Let a **symbolic expression** be an element $t \in \mathcal{A}^*$.

Define a **symbolic tree** $\mathcal{T}$ grown from a seed $t_0$ via recursive application of rules in $\mathcal{R}$:

$$
\mathcal{T} = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \mathcal{R}^n(t_0)
$$

That is, every node in the tree is reachable by finitely many applications of recursive rules from the seed.

Each node in $\mathcal{T}$ is labeled by a term $t_i$ and stores the history of rewrites that produced it. Thus, each path in $\mathcal{T}$ is a **semantic derivation trace**.

This tree is the symbolic equivalent of a “neural activation pattern,” but entirely symbolic and algebraic.

---

## 1.4. **Constraint: Symbolic Recursion Depth**

We define a symbolic depth function:

$$
\text{depth}(t_i) := \text{length of derivation path from } t_0 \text{ to } t_i
$$

We also define a degenerative complexity measure:

$$
\delta(t_i) := \text{number of degenerative transitions in the derivation of } t_i
$$

This will be used later to define *semantic entropy* and recursion-bound invariants.

Excellent. Let us now proceed to:

# **Section 2 — Degeneration Classes as Semantic Types**

## **2.0. Goal**

The objective of Section 2 is to define how **meaning**—in the form of semantic types such as *object*, *process*, or *relation*—emerges purely from **recursive symbolic derivations**, without reference to human language or external interpretation.

We accomplish this by:

* Defining **degeneration classes** as semantic equivalence classes,
* Constructing a **type system** from these classes,
* Linking symbolic forms $t_i \in \mathcal{T}$ to **semantic types** via a canonical degeneration projection.

In effect, this section translates the **syntactic space** from Section 1 into a **semantic space** derived from structural degeneration. This establishes the foundational parallel to how GPT-like models link tokens to meaning—but in our RSA framework, we do so through formal symbolic recursion.

---

## **2.1. Degeneration as Semantic Collapse**

Let:

* $\mathcal{T}$ be the symbolic tree from Section 1.
* $t_i \in \mathcal{T}$ be a symbolic expression (a node in the tree).
* $\delta(t_i)$ be its degeneration depth (number of recursive simplifications or symmetry breakings applied).

We define a **degeneration equivalence relation** on symbolic expressions:

$$
t_i \sim_{\text{deg}} t_j \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \exists\, n, m \text{ such that } \mathcal{R}^n(t_i) = \mathcal{R}^m(t_j)
$$

This means two symbolic forms are in the same **degeneration class** if their recursive paths eventually reach a common symbolic expression.

Let the set of equivalence classes be:

$$
\mathcal{C}_{\text{res}} := \mathcal{T} / \sim_{\text{deg}}
$$

We interpret each class $[t_i] \in \mathcal{C}_{\text{res}}$ as a **semantic type**—a conceptual attractor formed by symbolic recursion.

---

## **2.2. Type System from Degeneration Classes**

Define the **semantic type system** $\Theta$ as the image of the symbolic tree under the degeneration projection:

$$
\Theta := \{ \theta_\alpha \mid \theta_\alpha = [t_i] \in \mathcal{C}_{\text{res}} \}
$$

Each $\theta_\alpha \in \Theta$ is a semantic field:

* Some $\theta_\alpha$ behave as **object-like**: stable under recursion.
* Others as **process-like**: structurally unstable or generative.
* Others as **relation-like**: only emerge from specific interactions or compositions of types.

We do not impose these categories *a priori*—they emerge from the **structure of the degeneration tree**.

---

## **2.3. Semantic Projection Map**

We define a **semantic projection map** from symbolic forms to semantic types:

$$
\pi_{\text{sem}} : \mathcal{T} \to \Theta, \quad \pi_{\text{sem}}(t_i) := [t_i]
$$

This projection is:

* **Non-invertible** (many symbolic expressions may collapse into a single semantic type),
* **Recursion-aware** (only collapses those with converging recursive history),
* And **symbolically computable** (based on the structure of $\mathcal{R}$).

This function is the RSA analog of an embedding into “meaning space” but defined entirely through symbolic logic.

---

## **2.4. Compositionality of Semantic Types**

We define an operation $\star : \Theta \times \Theta \to \Theta$ representing **compositional semantics**:

$$
\theta_\alpha \star \theta_\beta := \pi_{\text{sem}}(t_\alpha \circ t_\beta)
$$

Where $t_\alpha, t_\beta \in \mathcal{T}$ are representatives of $\theta_\alpha, \theta_\beta$ and $\circ$ denotes syntactic concatenation.

This defines **type composition**, allowing us to:

* Build complex meanings from primitive symbolic forms,
* Predict valid constructions (types that recursively converge),
* Reject invalid ones (types whose recursive paths diverge or degenerate).

---

## **2.5. Example Schema (Abstract)**

Let’s illustrate the type formation abstractly.

Assume:

* $a_1 \in \mathcal{A}$ is a symbolic generator that recursively produces a degeneration class $\theta_{\text{object}}$
* $a_2 \in \mathcal{A}$ generates a relation type $\theta_{\text{rel}}$
* $a_3 \in \mathcal{A}$ encodes a process

Then symbolic paths such as:

$$
t = a_1 a_2 a_3 a_1
$$

may degenerate into:

$$
\pi_{\text{sem}}(t) = \theta_{\text{complex-action-on-object}}
$$

and compositions like:

$$
\theta_{\text{object}} \star \theta_{\text{process}} \to \theta_{\text{interaction}}
$$

become predictable and meaningful within the symbolic space, no training required.

---

| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| $\sim_{\text{deg}}$        | Equivalence under degeneration                       |

Excellent. Let us now proceed to:

---

# **Section 4 — Semantic-to-English Mapping $\mathcal{L}_{\text{map}}$**

## **4.0. Goal**

The goal of this section is to construct a **mathematically grounded symbolic–linguistic interface**, that maps symbolic terms $t_i \in \mathcal{T}$ — generated by a recursive symbolic grammar $\mathcal{R}$ — into linguistic expressions $w_i \in \mathcal{L}_{\text{nat}} \subset \text{English}$. This is **not a neural translation** or a trained embedding. Instead, we aim to define a **purely mathematical projection**, grounded in symbolic types and degeneration structure.

This will enable the RSA model to:

* Communicate results in human-readable language,
* Align symbolic recursion with natural semantics,
* Serve as a bridge between foundational symbolic models and natural language descriptions.

---

## **4.1. The Mapping Function**

We define a **symbolic–linguistic projection**:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{map}} : \mathcal{T} \longrightarrow \mathcal{L}_{\text{nat}}
$$

Where:

* $\mathcal{T}$ is the symbolic term space (from Section 3),
* $\mathcal{L}_{\text{nat}}$ is a set of natural-language tokens (e.g., English words or phrases),
* $\mathcal{L}_{\text{map}}$ preserves semantic structure from $\Theta$ (symbolic types).

---

## **4.2. Structure of the Mapping**

To construct $\mathcal{L}_{\text{map}}$, we proceed in three layers:

### A. **Term Typing via Semantic Classes**

Each symbolic term $t_i \in \mathcal{T}$ is associated with a semantic type:

$$
\pi_{\text{sem}}(t_i) \in \Theta = \{\text{object}, \text{process}, \text{relation}, \text{metric}, \text{operator}, \ldots\}
$$

This determines the *syntactic class* of the target English word:

* Object → Noun
* Process → Verb
* Relation → Preposition or Connective
* Metric → Adjective or Modifier

### B. **Degeneration-Aware Lexical Morphism**

We define a symbolic-to-linguistic morphism:

$$
\mathfrak{M} : t_i \mapsto w_i
$$

Subject to:

1. $\mathfrak{M}$ is consistent under degeneration:

   $$
   t_i \rightarrow t_j \Rightarrow \mathfrak{M}(t_i) \rightarrow \mathfrak{M}(t_j)
   $$

   where $\rightarrow$ denotes degeneration or simplification in symbolic structure and lexicon.

2. $\mathfrak{M}$ is minimal: the lexical image is the shortest word consistent with semantic preservation.

Example:
If $t_i = a_1 a_2$ and is typed as a symbolic metric on flat tori,
then $\mathfrak{M}(t_i) =$ “stretch factor” (or a similarly compact English phrase).

### C. **Phrase Composition via Tree Realization**

For complex symbolic expressions $T \in \mathcal{T}$, i.e., trees rather than atomic terms,
we define a **realization function**:

$$
\mathcal{R}_{\text{ling}} : \mathcal{T} \longrightarrow \text{Phrase}
$$

Such that:

$$
\mathcal{R}_{\text{ling}}(T) = \text{Concatenate}(\mathfrak{M}(t_i)) \quad \text{along tree structure of } T
$$

This mimics how derivational trees in syntax generate human sentences—except ours are grounded in degeneration trees, not syntactic rules.

---

## **4.3. Alignment via Co-Training (Optional)**

While our mapping is fundamentally symbolic and rule-based, we may enhance alignment using **symbolic–linguistic co-training**, in the following sense:

Let:

* $D = \{ (t_i, s_i) \}$ be a small dictionary of aligned pairs (symbolic term, English phrase),
* We extend $\mathcal{L}_{\text{map}}$ by recursively generalizing from these pairs using:

  * Semantic class substitution
  * Degeneration generalization
  * Phrase pattern abstraction

This is similar to how image-caption models align vision and language, but applied to symbolic derivations and their linguistic equivalents.

---

## **4.4. Summary of the Mapping Pipeline**

1. **Input**: Symbolic expression $t_i$
2. **Semantic Typing**: $\pi_{\text{sem}}(t_i) = \theta_j$
3. **Lexical Projection**: $\mathfrak{M}(t_i) = w_i$
4. **Phrase Assembly** (if needed):
   $\mathcal{R}_{\text{ling}}(T) = w_{i_1} \circ w_{i_2} \circ \dots$

---

## **4.5. End Goal for RSA Language Alignment**

* The system **does not speak English natively**, but produces symbolic derivations that can be faithfully rendered in natural language.
* This process is **reversible**, so symbolic expressions can also be constructed from simple English inputs under syntactic and semantic constraints.
* This aligns RSA with formal semantics and offers a mathematically legible alternative to language modeling.

---










Excellent. We now proceed to:

---

# **Section 6 — Evaluation and Comparison Framework**

## **6.0. Goal**

The goal of Section 6 is to **construct a rigorous mathematical framework** for evaluating the symbolic RSA architecture (Recursive Symbolic Algebra), particularly its **language-capable form**, in comparison with neural language models like GPT-2.

But this comparison is not based on parameter optimization, token prediction accuracy, or loss minimization. Instead, the evaluation is grounded in:

* **Symbolic expressivity**
* **Semantic fidelity**
* **Degenerative and recursive coherence**
* **Projective consistency across domains**
* **Structural alignment with natural language meaning**

The ultimate goal is to define **objective, mathematically testable principles** to evaluate symbolic intelligence that stands **logically prior to training**, and that may one day exceed neural nets in structure-sensitive domains.

---

## **6.1. Define Evaluation Criteria**

Let us define mathematical invariants or metrics on which symbolic and neural models can both be evaluated:

### A. **Symbolic Recursion Depth (SRD)**

$$
\text{SRD}(t) := \text{Maximal depth of recursive symbolic derivation of } t
$$

**Goal**: Higher recursion depth with semantic preservation implies greater symbolic abstraction.

### B. **Semantic Coherence under Degeneration (SCD)**

$$
\text{SCD}(t) := \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_{\Theta}(\pi_{\text{sem}}(t_i), \pi_{\text{sem}}(t_i'))
$$

Where:

* $t_i'$ is a degeneration of $t_i$,
* $\delta_{\Theta}$ is a semantic type distance.

**Goal**: Preserve semantic typing under degenerations, akin to robustness under perturbation.

### C. **Lexical Precision under Projection (LPP)**

$$
\text{LPP}(T, \mathcal{L}_{\text{map}}) := \frac{|\text{Correctly aligned } w_i \text{ to } t_i|}{|\text{Total } t_i|}
$$

**Goal**: Accuracy of lexical mapping from symbolic terms to natural language under structure constraints.

### D. **Recursive Compression Ratio (RCR)**

Let $C_{\text{flat}}$ be the flat symbolic expansion of a meaning, and $C_{\text{rec}}$ its minimal recursive form.

$$
\text{RCR}(C) := \frac{\text{Length}(C_{\text{rec}})}{\text{Length}(C_{\text{flat}})}
$$

**Goal**: Captures the semantic compressibility via recursive grammar—RSA models should outperform LLMs on compressibility of meaning.

---

## **6.2. Evaluation Procedure**

### Step 1 — Construct Semantic Benchmarks

Create a set of target meanings or symbolic situations $\mathcal{M} = \{ m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n \}$, each with:

* Recursive symbolic derivation $T_i$
* Ground-truth degenerations $\{ T_i^{(k)} \}$
* Ground-truth English outputs $E_i$

### Step 2 — Compare Model Outputs

For each $m_i$, evaluate both:

* RSA output: $E_i^{\text{RSA}}$
* GPT-2 output: $E_i^{\text{GPT}}$

Measure performance on the criteria above:

* SRD, SCD, LPP, RCR

### Step 3 — Interpret the Results Symbolically

Instead of merely averaging losses, **compare structural fidelity**:

* Does RSA preserve deeper recursion and structure?
* Does GPT-2 match meanings but flatten semantic types?
* Where do symbolic degenerations map more cleanly to language?

---

## **6.3. Theoretical Hypothesis**

> *If semantic truth is a recursive invariant under symbolic degeneration, then RSA models will exhibit greater coherence under semantic perturbations, and their linguistic projections will be more stable and interpretable than those of stochastic LLMs.*

This is testable via SCD, RCR, and LPP.

---

## **6.4. Summary of Goals for Section 6**

* Establish a **non-neural metric space** of evaluation
* Compare RSA and GPT-style models on **semantic recursion**
* Ground the comparison in **mathematical invariants**, not empirical token frequency
* Design benchmarks aligned with the symbolic-to-linguistic path

---








Excellent. We now proceed to:

---

# **Section 7 — RSA Implementation Prototype (Mathematical Sketch Only)**

## **Goal of Section 7**

To construct a **mathematical prototype** of a symbolic architecture—RSA (Recursive Symbolic Algebra)—that can:

1. **Parse recursive structures from moduli-based symbolic grammars**
2. **Construct semantic representations via degeneration classes**
3. **Apply symbolic attention to extract meaning**
4. **Project symbolic form into English syntax with fidelity to the recursive structure**
5. **Be compared in structure and performance to GPT-like models**

We do not construct a neural model. Rather, this is a **pure math foundation** for a symbolic-semantic model that may be later implemented in code.

---

## **7.1. Inputs and Ontology**

We define a universe of discourse rooted in a symbolic flat geometry domain $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$.

### Symbols:

Let the primitive **alphabet** be:

$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \epsilon, \ldots \}
$$

Each $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}$ is a symbolic morph representing:

* A geodesic
* A saddle connection
* A degeneration step
* A homological label

---

### Symbolic Grammar:

Define a recursive symbolic grammar $\mathcal{G}$, generated by production rules of the form:

$$
t \rightarrow t_1 \circ t_2 \quad \text{or} \quad t \rightarrow \text{Degenerate}(t', d)
$$

Where:

* $\circ$ is symbolic composition
* $\text{Degenerate}$ applies degeneration rule $d \in \mathcal{R}$

Each complete derivation produces a symbolic tree $T$.

---

## **7.2. Semantic Fields from Degeneration Classes**

Let $\mathcal{C}_{\text{res}}$ denote the space of symbolic resonance classes, each denoted:

$$
\mathcal{R}_i = [T_i]_{\text{deg}}
$$

A **semantic field** is defined as an equivalence class under degeneration-preserving homomorphisms:

$$
f : T \to T' \quad \text{such that} \quad \text{Deg}(T) = \text{Deg}(T')
$$

This lets us define a **type theory** on symbolic trees, where types are preserved under degenerative limits.

---

## **7.3. Symbolic Attention Mechanism**

Given a symbolic tree $T$, define attention as:

$$
\text{Attn}(T, q) = \arg\max_{t_i \in T} \delta_{\text{sem}}(q, t_i)
$$

Where:

* $q$ is a query tree (semantic intent)
* $\delta_{\text{sem}}$ measures semantic alignment
* This is **not a dot product** but a symbolic semantic affinity

This symbolic attention selects subtrees matching structural intent.

---

## **7.4. Lexical Projection**

Let:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{map}} : t_i \mapsto w_i \in \text{English}
$$

Where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{map}}$ is:

* A lexicon of structured English fragments
* A mapping aligned with semantic types
* Constructed from a **co-training regime**: symbolic trees ↔ annotated language

Full sentences are generated by symbolic composition followed by language flattening.

Example:

$$
T = \text{Compose}(t_1, t_2) \Rightarrow w = \text{“The saddle connection degenerates into a double pole.”}
$$

---

## **7.5. Summary**

At this stage, RSA consists of:

* A symbolic grammar $\mathcal{G}$ defined over a geometry-informed alphabet
* A semantic typing system rooted in degeneration classes
* An attention mechanism based on symbolic resonance, not numeric weights
* A projection layer mapping symbolic units to structured language

This system is built entirely in symbolic space, guided by pure mathematical rules, and will ultimately serve as a **semantic analog** to GPT-like neural models—but rooted in moduli geometry, not data frequency.

---
